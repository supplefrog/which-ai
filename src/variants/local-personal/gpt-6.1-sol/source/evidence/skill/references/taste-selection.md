# Fast visual taste selection

Use when a material visual taste decision is unresolved, or when the user asks for inspiration or comparisons. Routine repairs within an approved system, explicitly delegated selection, or a request to skip comparisons can bypass this taste-selection exercise, not the [checks and visual review before commit](../SKILL.md#checks-and-visual-review-before-commit) requirement for appearance changes. This is a lightweight way to obtain preferences, not a claim that models cannot design or that a particular skill helps every model.

## Make the choice visible

When a material taste decision remains unresolved and the user has not delegated it or asked to skip comparisons, make the decision viewable: show a small comparison using the same representative content or surface, with concise labels and the meaningful tradeoff, instead of asking which they prefer in plain chat. Deliver it in the user's response surface; a tool-only capture or unshared file is not a comparison delivered to the user. Keep the comparison scoped to the decision—no fixed option count or whole redesign is required. The user can choose, combine qualities, reject the directions, or delegate the choice. If the available host cannot show an interactive preview, use the labelled screenshots and short reply format below.

For inspiration requests, do the filtering: start with a small set of specific real projects matched to the site's purpose and known preferences, not gallery homepages or search-result dumps. Name the best starting point and the relevant quality and limitation of each reference. Offer broad discovery resources when the user asks to browse widely; if breadth feels burdensome, narrow the set rather than asking the user to sort bookmarks or explain their taste first. Existing references are optional inputs, not homework or evidence of endorsement. Do not answer a request for discovery by building more invented options.

Inspect the visual evidence supporting a recommendation. When the reference's appeal involves interaction, navigate the actual site with an isolated browser instead of stopping at a gallery screenshot or text extraction. Take a bounded tour of the relevant flow: follow a content route, trigger the distinctive interaction, inspect its open/closed and relevant responsive states, and capture the states that change the design decision. Use the available browser-control workflow; do not disturb the user's browser, sign in, or perform consequential actions merely to inspect inspiration. If access fails, try a non-disruptive alternative, then label the remaining limits. Distinguish observed behavior from controls merely listed by the site and from inferred implementation. Static composition references and routine repairs do not require a whole-site tour.

Extract the transferable interaction and its tradeoff, not a feature requirement: an appealing window can inspire presentation without justifying a terminal, workbench or simulated backend. Preserve meaningful discoveries in the original site by inspecting their actual setup and payoff. Record URLs, paths taken and useful captures in the project, not in the shared skill. Search descriptions alone do not establish visual quality or usability.

When the user requests mockups, supplies references, or has narrowed the qualities to compare, use a few small treatments of the same real content or a representative viewport. Vary meaningful composition, hierarchy or image treatment—not only accent color. Do not build several complete apps, install style suites, generate assets or run model tournaments just to offer a choice.

Keep content and task comparable. Label original mockups versus external inspiration; provide the original links and say which quality each reference illustrates. A gallery is for discovery, not permission to copy branding, assets or code. Prefer a small diverse initial set with a route to explore more, rather than a large fixed theme catalog. The user's own references can replace the entire set.

Offer reactions that change the next step:

- choose a direction;
- more like this, varying one meaningful dimension;
- combine named qualities from different options;
- none of these / explore a different direction;
- let the agent choose.

A dislike of color does not reject layout. Record preferences by quality and page purpose: expressive homepage typography need not become the type used for scanning notes or copying code. Ask what to keep only when the reaction is ambiguous; avoid design jargon and a compulsory questionnaire. Once a direction is selected, refine it rather than restarting the selection process.

## Make iteration cheap

Local controls can preview a few relevant choices—density, type size or image emphasis—without a model call per adjustment. Controls should expose useful decisions, not every CSS token. Preserve an original/reset state, clear selection and keyboard operation. Show the current choice immediately; send or apply it only through a deliberate action. On hosts without interactive previews, use labelled screenshots and a short reply format instead.

The optional [taste-picker.html](../templates/taste-picker.html) demonstrates this interaction with original learning-interface mockups. It is not a default style pack: replace its sample content/directions for the actual task. It works locally; a host may wire its `taste-choice` event to conversation input. Host-specific messaging belongs in the host adapter or preview copy, not a required dependency of this portable template.

## Remember only what the choice establishes

Record the chosen qualities, rejected qualities, reference URLs and scope in the current design context. Do not infer a permanent personal aesthetic from one selection. If the user explicitly wants a reusable preference, retain it in the applicable owner, distinct from universal engineering rules. Accessibility, factual integrity and task completion are not optional style choices.

## Skill influence is an experiment, not a default truth

Distinguish engineering guidance from stylistic scaffolding. Community reports can justify inspecting an over-prescriptive rule; they cannot establish that every skill helps or harms a model. When a comparison is requested and authorized, include a minimal/no-extra-style-guidance baseline with the same task, assets, model/runtime and effort. This is not a safety-free baseline. Judge rendered usefulness and the user's preference; record untested variables and stop when the decision is clear. Do not claim a no-skill experiment when the normal harness still injected the skill.
